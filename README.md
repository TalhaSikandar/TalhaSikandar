##  Featured Projects

### [megaman-co] â€” LSTM-Based Stock Price Predictor  
Crafted from scratch using Numpy in Pythonâ€”no TensorFlow or PyTorch. Built to decode time series using deep learning and understand the internals of LSTM networks at a fundamental level.

### [bluefin_hr] â€” C Framework for Hot-Reloading Shared Libraries  
Legend: Created an academic-grade dynamic linking system to enable seamless `.so` hot-reloads during runtimeâ€”ideal for improving development workflows and minimizing downtime.

### [fourier_t] â€” DFT & FFT Signal Processing in C  
Implemented Fourier Transform algorithms from the ground upâ€”practiced signal processing techniques using both Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms in pure C.

### [fat_fs] â€” Custom FAT File System  
Engineered a simulated virtual disk environmentâ€”managing file metadata, cluster allocation, and directory structure using a custom FAT-style file system.

### [krypton-f] â€” Full-Stack Supply Chain Management App  
Built with Django (REST API) and Vue.jsâ€”a comprehensive system to streamline company, product, inventory, and warehouse management. Great hands-on exposure to backend and frontend integration.

### [dotfiles] â€” Portable Dev Environment Setup  
Stow-powered dotfiles repository for scalable and clean setup of Linux development environmentsâ€”streamlined, customizable configurations to jump-start any machine.
